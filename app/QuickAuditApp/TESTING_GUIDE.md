# QuickAudit App - Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide provides multiple approaches to test the QuickAudit app before official launch. Since we're encountering some build issues with the native Android and iOS versions, this document outlines alternative testing methods to verify the app's functionality.

## Testing Options

### Option 1: Expo Snack (No Setup Required)

The quickest way to test the app's UI and basic functionality:

1. Visit [Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.dev/) in your browser
2. Paste the minimal App.js code we created
3. Test directly in the browser preview or scan the QR code with Expo Go app on your device

This allows you to test:
- UI components and styling
- Navigation between screens
- Basic interactions

### Option 2: Test Web App Version

If you want to test the complete web app version of QuickAudit:

1. Visit the production web app at your deployed URL
2. Use the same credentials as you would for the mobile app
3. Test all functionality in the browser

This allows you to verify:
- Feature parity between web and planned mobile versions
- Data synchronization
- Account management
- Payment processing

### Option 3: Manual Testing with Screenshots

Review the app's functionality through screenshots and documentation:

1. Review the `WEB_MOBILE_COMPARISON.md` document
2. Examine the screenshots in the `screenshots` directory
3. Walk through each user flow as documented

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Sync when connection is restored
- [ ] Access cached data offline

## Next Steps After Testing

Once you've verified the app's functionality through one or more of these methods:

1. **Document any issues** found during testing
2. **Prioritize fixes** based on severity and impact
3. **Continue resolving build issues** using the steps in `FINAL_CHECKLIST.md`
4. **Prepare app store assets** for submission

## Build Issue Resolution Plan

We're actively working on resolving the build issues. Here's our plan:

1. **Android Build Issues**:
   - Fix Flipper dependencies by removing them from debug builds
   - Resolve resource duplication during bundling
   - Create a clean, minimal build for testing

2. **iOS Build Issues**:
   - Install correct iOS simulator runtime
   - Resolve CocoaPods installation issues
   - Fix linking errors for native modules

## Conclusion

While we continue to resolve the build issues, these alternative testing methods will allow you to verify the app's functionality and gather feedback. This approach ensures that development can proceed in parallel with testing, ultimately leading to a more polished final product for launch.
