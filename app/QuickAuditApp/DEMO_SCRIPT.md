"Today I'm excited to present QuickAudit, a mobile application designed to streamline and modernize the audit process. QuickAudit allows field auditors to conduct inspections efficiently, generate comprehensive reports, and track compliance issues all from their mobile device."

## Demo Flow (10 minutes)

### 1. Login Screen (1 minute)
- "The app starts with a clean, professional login screen where users can authenticate with their credentials."
- "We've implemented secure authentication with role-based access control for field auditors, supervisors, and clients."
- "Let me log in as a field auditor to show you the core functionality."

### 2. Dashboard (2 minutes)

- "The dashboard also displays key metrics like compliance rates and upcoming deadlines."
- "Let's select this audit to see the details."

### 3. Audit Form (3 minutes)
- "This is the audit form screen where field auditors conduct their inspections."
- "The form is organized into logical sections based on the audit type."
- "For each item, auditors can mark it as compliant, non-compliant, or not applicable."
- "When marking an item as non-compliant, they can add notes and attach photos as evidence."
- "The app works offline, so auditors can complete their work even in areas with poor connectivity."
- "Once the audit is complete, let's generate a report."

### 4. Report Summary Screen (2 minutes)
- "The Report Summary screen provides a comprehensive overview of the audit results."
- "At the top, we see the overall compliance score, which is calculated based on the responses."
- "Below that, we have a breakdown of scores by section, making it easy to identify problem areas."
- "The app automatically identifies non-compliance issues and groups them by section."
- "This makes it easy for stakeholders to understand where improvements are needed."

### 5. Audit Report Screen (2 minutes)
- "Finally, we have the detailed Audit Report screen that clients and supervisors can access."
- "This screen shows all findings, including photos and notes from the field auditor."
- "For each non-compliance issue, the system suggests action items to address the problem."
- "Reports can be shared via email, exported as PDFs, or accessed directly through the app."
- "Clients can track the status of action items and mark them as complete when resolved."
