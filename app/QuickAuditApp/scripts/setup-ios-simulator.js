iOS Simulator Setup Guide
===============================================

We've detected that you don't have iOS simulator runtimes installed.
To run the QuickAudit app on an iOS simulator, you'll need to:

1. Open Xcode (install it from the App Store if you don't have it)

2. Go to Xcode > Preferences > Components

3. Download and install an iOS simulator runtime (iOS 16.4 or later recommended)

4. Once installed, you can run the app on the simulator with:
   cd /Users/vivekmangipudi/Desktop/QuickAudit/app/QuickAuditApp
   npx react-native run-ios

Alternative: Use the Web Version
===============================================
While setting up the iOS simulator, you can use the web version of the app:
http://localhost:3000

This provides a functional preview of the app's UI and navigation.
