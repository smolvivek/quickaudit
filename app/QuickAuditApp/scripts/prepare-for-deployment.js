## Overview

This guide provides instructions for deploying the QuickAudit app to both iOS and Android platforms. The app has been fully prepared for deployment with all TypeScript errors fixed, payment gateways integrated, and all required features implemented.

## Prerequisites

- Xcode 14+ (for iOS)
- Android Studio (for Android)
- Node.js 16+
- React Native CLI
- Apple Developer Account (for iOS)
- Google Play Developer Account (for Android)

## Environment Setup

The app uses environment configuration for sensitive data like API keys. Before building, ensure the \`src/config/env.ts\` file has the correct values for your environment.

## Building for iOS

1. **Install dependencies**
   \`\`\`
   cd /path/to/QuickAuditApp
   npm install
   cd ios
   pod install
   \`\`\`

2. **Configure signing in Xcode**
   - Open \`ios/QuickAuditApp.xcworkspace\` in Xcode
   - Select the project in the Project Navigator
   - Select the "QuickAuditApp" target
   - Go to the "Signing & Capabilities" tab
   - Select your team and update the bundle identifier if needed

3. **Build and archive**
   - In Xcode, select "Generic iOS Device" as the build target
   - Select Product > Archive
   - Once archiving is complete, click "Distribute App"
   - Follow the prompts to upload to App Store Connect

## Building for Android

1. **Configure signing**
   - Create a keystore file if you don't have one:
     \`\`\`
     keytool -genkey -v -keystore quickaudit.keystore -alias quickaudit -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
     \`\`\`
   - Place the keystore file in \`android/app\`
   - Update \`android/gradle.properties\` with your keystore details:
     \`\`\`
     MYAPP_UPLOAD_STORE_FILE=quickaudit.keystore
     MYAPP_UPLOAD_KEY_ALIAS=quickaudit
     MYAPP_UPLOAD_STORE_PASSWORD=*****
     MYAPP_UPLOAD_KEY_PASSWORD=*****
     \`\`\`

2. **Build release APK/AAB**
   \`\`\`
   cd /path/to/QuickAuditApp
   cd android
   ./gradlew bundleRelease
   \`\`\`
   
   This will generate an AAB file at \`android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab\`

3. **Testing the release build**
   - For APK: \`./gradlew assembleRelease\`
   - Install on device: \`adb install app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk\`
