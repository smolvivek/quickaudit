## üîß Troubleshooting Build Issues

### Android Build Issues
The current Android build is encountering issues with Flipper dependencies. Here are the steps to resolve them:

1. **Fix Flipper Issues**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/vivekmangipudi/Desktop/QuickAudit/app/QuickAuditApp
   node scripts/fix-flipper-issues.js
   cd android && ./gradlew clean
   ```

2. **Try Minimal App Approach**:
   If you're still encountering build issues, you can try the minimal app approach:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/vivekmangipudi/Desktop/QuickAudit/app/QuickAuditApp
   node scripts/create-minimal-app.js
   cd android && ./gradlew clean
   ./scripts/build-minimal-apk.sh
   ```

3. **Manual Dependency Cleanup**:
   If the above steps don't work, you may need to manually clean up dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/vivekmangipudi/Desktop/QuickAudit/app/QuickAuditApp
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm cache clean --force
   npm install
   cd android && ./gradlew clean
   ```

### iOS Build Issues
For iOS, you need to install the correct simulator runtime:

1. **Install Xcode Command Line Tools**:
   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```

2. **Install iOS Simulator Runtime**:
   Open Xcode > Preferences > Components > Simulators and download the iOS 16.4 or later simulator.

3. **Clean and Rebuild**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/vivekmangipudi/Desktop/QuickAudit/app/QuickAuditApp
   rm -rf ios/build
   cd ios && pod install
   cd .. && npx react-native run-ios
   ```

## üì± Testing the App

Since there are still some build issues to resolve, you can test the app functionality in the following ways:

### Option 1: Use Expo Go (Quickest for Testing)
If you want to quickly test the app's functionality without dealing with build issues:

1. **Install Expo CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```

2. **Create a temporary Expo project**:
   ```bash
   npx create-expo-app QuickAuditExpo
   cd QuickAuditExpo
   ```

3. **Copy your minimal App.js**:
   Copy the content from the minimal App.js created by the `create-minimal-app.js` script.

4. **Run with Expo Go**:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

5. **Test on physical devices**:
   Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device.

### Option 2: Use React Native Web
Test the app's functionality in a web browser:

1. **Add web support**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/vivekmangipudi/Desktop/QuickAudit/app/QuickAuditApp
   npm install react-dom react-native-web
   ```

2. **Create a web entry point**:
   Create `index.web.js` with the same content as `index.js`.

3. **Start the web version**:
   ```bash
   npx react-native start --web
   ```
