# QuickAudit Offline Integration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the strategy for implementing offline functionality in the QuickAudit app, ensuring that field auditors can work without internet connectivity and seamlessly sync their data when connectivity is restored.

## Offline Architecture

### Client-Side Storage
- **Primary Storage**: SQLite database for React Native (using react-native-sqlite-storage)
- **State Management**: Redux with persistence (using redux-persist)
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem for images and attachments

### Sync Strategy
- **Optimistic UI Updates**: Allow users to work offline with immediate local updates
- **Background Sync**: Automatic synchronization when connectivity is restored
- **Conflict Resolution**: Three-way merge strategy for handling conflicts
- **Sync Queue**: Prioritized queue for pending changes
- **Selective Sync**: Download only relevant data for the current user

## Implementation Components

### 1. Local Database Schema
The local database will mirror the server database schema with additional sync-related fields:
- `syncStatus`: Enum ('synced', 'pending_sync', 'conflict')
- `syncId`: Unique identifier for tracking entities across devices
- `lastModified`: Timestamp of last local modification
- `serverVersion`: Timestamp of last server version

### 2. Network Status Monitoring
- Implement network connectivity detection
- Provide visual indicators of sync status
- Allow manual sync triggering

### 3. Data Access Layer
- Create a unified data access layer that abstracts the data source
- Implement repository pattern to handle both local and remote data
- Provide consistent API regardless of connectivity status

### 4. Sync Service
- Implement background sync service
- Handle data upload and download
- Manage sync conflicts
- Track sync history and status

### 5. Conflict Resolution
- Detect conflicts during sync
- Implement automatic resolution for non-critical conflicts
- Provide user interface for manual conflict resolution
- Maintain audit trail of conflict resolutions

## Offline-Capable Features

### Audit Execution
- Download audit templates for offline use
- Capture photos and store locally
- Complete audit forms without connectivity
- Queue completed audits for sync

### Action Management
- View assigned actions offline
- Update action status and progress
- Add comments and attachments
- Queue changes for sync

### User Authentication
- Implement token-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Store encrypted credentials securely
- Handle session expiration gracefully
- Support biometric authentication for quick access

## Sync Process Flow

1. **Initial Sync**:
   - Download all relevant data for the user
   - Store in local database
   - Cache images and attachments

2. **Offline Work**:
   - Record all changes in local database
   - Mark changed records with 'pending_sync' status
   - Store new images and attachments locally

3. **Connectivity Restored**:
   - Detect network availability
   - Start background sync process
   - Upload pending changes to server
   - Download server changes
   - Resolve conflicts
   - Update sync status

4. **Conflict Handling**:
   - Compare local and server versions
   - Apply automatic resolution rules where possible
   - Queue complex conflicts for user resolution
   - Provide clear interface for resolving conflicts

## Performance Considerations

- **Data Volume Management**: Implement data retention policies
- **Bandwidth Optimization**: Compress data and use delta updates
- **Battery Efficiency**: Schedule sync operations to minimize battery impact
- **Storage Efficiency**: Clean up old data and temporary files

## Security Considerations

- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data in local storage
- **Secure Authentication**: Store tokens securely using keychain/keystore
- **Data Validation**: Validate data integrity before and after sync
- **Access Control**: Maintain role-based access control in offline mode

## Testing Strategy

- **Connectivity Scenarios**: Test various network conditions
- **Conflict Scenarios**: Test different conflict cases
- **Data Volume**: Test with realistic data volumes
- **Device Variations**: Test across different devices and OS versions
- **Battery Impact**: Measure battery consumption during sync
